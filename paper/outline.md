0. Abstract
    Argued problems with accepting a layering of reality via some manner of non-reductive emergence turn out to stem not from a specific conception of emergence but rather from the non-specificity of most conceptions of emergence so far considered. Any bet on emergence being \ti{real} or \ti{unreal} should be refunded. I argue that a specification of emergence as process-centric, causally efficacious, and ontologically-novel both nearly addresses the causal overdetermination, downward-causation and epistemic-not-ontological arguments against such strong emergentism, as well as explains its own development.

1. The Idea of Emergence
    1. history of specifying emergence (Fodor, McLaughin)
    2. canonical examples of emergence (McLaughin, ?Searle)
    3. utility of a concept of emergence (Bedau)
2. Epistemic and Ontological
    1. how emergence could all be in the mind (Bedau, Dennett)
    2. implications of epistemic emergence (Bedau, Dennet)
    3. motivations and evidence for ontological emergence
        1. success and direction of special sciences (Bedau)
3. Strong and Weak Emergence
    1. explanation of strong emergence
    2. weak emergence
    3. overdetermination and downward causation arguments
    4. replies to arguments, showing weak emergence to be most promising
    5. relevance of weak emergence to the epistemic/ontological distinction - Bedau vs. Wilson (Wilson Ch5)
    6. defense of Bedau
