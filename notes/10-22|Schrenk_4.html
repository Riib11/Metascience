If we then ask a philosopher, they can give an answer in terms of language, and then the original scientist confirms.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">How does the philosopher tell?</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="italic">Definition</span>. An operator is <span class="bold">opaque</span> if you cannot replace the operants with referent expressions to the original operants without changing the operator application's truth value. For example, cannot change "Lois believes that Superman is not Clark Kent" to "Loise Belivies that Superman is Superman", in context of the "believes that" operator. An operator is <span class="bold">transparent</span> if this is possible. Sentences and terms can be opaque.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">But there seems to be a problem with this division of labor. We can't come up with good definitions of law-likeness without allowing some things we don't want to be laws. We care about <span class="italic">projectability</span> with laws, and this depends on empirical observation.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="italic">Note</span>. Goodman's solution is that <span class="italic">projectable</span> is just <span class="italic">that which has been projected</span>, or <span class="italic">entrenched</span>.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="bold">Problem</span>: in order for a system of laws to be <span class="italic">good</span> (strong and simple), it must be true, so we have to leave the armchain :(.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="bold">Problem</span>. choice of language for simplicity?</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="italic">Solution</span>. Use the language of natural properties and natural relations. Note that this doesn't tell us what natural properties are. In other words, this is a metaphysical statement and not an epistomological. We have to do science to find out what the natural properties are.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="italic">Definition</span>. <span class="bold">Nomic Neccessity</span> is what is true in all the worlds with the same laws (as ours).</span></p><h2 class="h2"><span class="span">Fred Dretske: Laws of Nature</span></h2><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">(on handout)</span></p></div></body>
