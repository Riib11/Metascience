<div id="container"><h1 class="h1"><span class="span">Real Patterns - Daniel Dennett</span></h1><h2 class="h2"><span class="span">Introduction</span></h2><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Dennett starts off with the question "are beliefs real?" Consider is it correct to <span class="italic">believe</span> in centers of gravity? Why or why not? Dennett gives examples of people that argue these kinds of beliefs are obviously unreal and others that argue they are obviously real (such as Dretske).</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">But consider completely arbitrary "centers", such as the center of population or the "center of Dennett's lost socks". Are thse just as real? Does is just have to do with usefulness or interest to decide how 'real' a pattern is?</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">So a question is, then, should we treat mental states (such as belief) as <span class="italic">real</span> in the same way and to the same degree as other patterns, such as electrons?</span></p><h2 class="h2"><span class="span">Reality of Pattens</span></h2><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Dennett gives the memorable <span class="bold">bar code</span> example. Its clear that the underlying Bar Code pattern is there for all of the cases, except for <span class="mathinline">\(E\)</span> and <span class="mathinline">\(F\)</span> where it starts to get iffy. In fact, in <span class="mathinline">\(F\)</span>, it is technically indistinguishable from random noise, from strictly an after-the-fact perspective (without looking at the generating code).</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Dennett refer's to Chaitin's idea of "incompressibility", in that patterns are recognizable because they are compressible while noise is incompressibile.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">But compressibility comes with two degrees of freedom:</span></p><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">accuracy</span></li><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">simplicity</span></li><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Usually, it is a trade-off from one to the other. Dennett argues that it is a design choice for which is more important in which circumstance, and that it isn't an inherent metaphysical fact about the reality of patterns themselves.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Dennett makes good use of the <span class="bold">Game of Life</span> examples.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Final point:</span></p><div class="quote"><span class="span">"File tuning could of course reduce these probabilities [of modelling which method was used to create a bar code pattern], but that is not my point. My point is that <span class="italic">even if</span> the evidence is substantial that the discernible pattern is produced by one process rather than another, it can be rational to ignore these differences and use the simplest pattern description (e.g. <span class="italic">bar code</span>) as one's way of oranizing the data..."</span></div></div></body>
