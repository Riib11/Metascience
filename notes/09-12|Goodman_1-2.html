<div id="container"><h1 class="h1"><span class="span">Fact, Fiction and Forecast, Goodman - Chapters 1 & 2</span></h1><h2 class="h2"><span class="span">Problems with counterfactuals:</span></h2><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="italic">The problem of semifactuals</span>. If we looks at the situation from a purely classoc-logical perspective, if a counterfactual is true then so is the same statement but with the opposite consequent, since in either one the antecedent if false.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="italic">The problem of relevant condition</span>. If we have a counterfactual with antecedent <span class="mathinline">\(A\)</span> and consequent <span class="mathinline">\(C\)</span>, then there is a set <span class="mathinline">\(S = \lnot A\)</span> such that <span class="mathinline">\(A \cdot S\)</span> entails anything. For example, we can have a counterfactual "if had P x, then Q x", and we have a true condition "not R x", which is among the <span class="mathinline">\(S\)</span> we mentioned (which means that, say "if not R x then not P x" is true but not necessarily "if not P x, then not R x"; its like I(R x) is a superset of I(P x)). Then we have as true generalizations "if not R x and if had P x, then Q x" and "if not R x and if had P x, then not Q x", since there are no so such "x" (since "if not R x, then not P x").</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="italic">The problem of cotenability</span>. A statement <span class="mathinline">\(A\)</span> is compatible but not cotenable with <span class="mathinline">\(B\)</span> if they do not contradict each other, but <span class="mathinline">\(B\)</span> would not be true if <span class="mathinline">\(A\)</span>. A statement <span class="mathinline">\(A\)</span> is cotenable with <span class="mathinline">\(B\)</span> if it is not the case that <span class="mathinline">\(B\)</span> would not be true if <span class="mathinline">\(A\)</span> were true. This is an attempt to solve the relevant condition problem, by excluding non-notenable statements from <span class="mathinline">\(S\)</span>.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="italic">The problem of laws</span>. What really counts as "law-like"? We want to include things that describe generally holding phenomenon, but sometimes things generally hold by accident, which we want to exclude from laws. If we allows 'accidental' laws, then laws would degenerate and just be an exact description of everything in the world.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="italic">Question</span>. Supposing A is our antecedent and C is our consequent, "if had A, then C", why can't we just say that if A were the case C would be the case if and only if C follows by law from A and some other true sentences?</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="italic">Answer</span>. Basically, the problem of the relevant condition. You can have things that are true sentences attached to the situation that would prevent <span class="mathinline">\(C\)</span> from being true.</span></p><h2 class="h2"><span class="span">The Passing of the Possible - Dispositions</span></h2><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="italic">Start Phenomenolistic</span>. We've got places, times, and basic sensations. Suppose that you're vision narrows so that you can't see the place, but can still see the time. Then you can connect them by summing them meriologically (a:place + t:time) to get an object that "place-time"s.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Then, we can project properties onto these meriological objects. And <span class="italic">induction</span> is projecting of these properties to other similar places and times, on the basis of <span class="italic">confermation theory</span>. So it all comes down to epistomology from there. But it all hinges on figuring out the riddle of induction.</span></p></div></body>
