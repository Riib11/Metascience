But in counterfactuals, there is such an implication.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="italic">Note</span>. Counterfactuals are all over the place in science, so we should try to exlain them or exlain them away.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="italic">Goal</span>. Explain counterfactuals non-circularly.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="italic">Goal</span>. Analyze law of nature.</span></p><p class="mathmultiline">$$

$$</p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">where <span class="mathinline">\(\textbf{N}\)</span> means "nomically necessary"</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Possible relevant conditions to exclude from <span class="mathinline">\(S\)</span>:</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="bold">1</span>. Exclude all facts that are incompatible with <span class="mathinline">\(A\)</span>. <span class="italic">Problem</span>: there are non-cotenable but compatible facts. For example, there could be a law about <span class="mathinline">\(x\)</span> (in <span class="mathinline">\(S x\)</span>) that prevents the satisfaction of <span class="mathinline">\(A x\)</span>.</span></p><p class="mathmultiline">$$

$$</p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="bold">2</span>. Exclude all laws that are empty (have no positive instances). <span class="italic">Problem</span>: can just make a law non-empty by irrelevant disjunction.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="bold">3</span>. Exclude all statements that are nominologically incompatible with <span class="mathinline">\(A\)</span>. <span class="italic">Problem</span>: suppose <span class="mathinline">\(A = Q \lor R\)</span>. Then <span class="mathinline">\(A\)</span> is cotenable with <span class="mathinline">\(Q\)</span> and, seperately, cotenable with <span class="mathinline">\(R\)</span>. Then, we get the two true counterfactuals below; but of course, these can't both be true.</span></p><p class="mathmultiline">$$
(A x \text{ }\Box\kern-1.5pt\raise1pt\hbox{$\mathord{\rightarrow}$}\text{ } Q x),
(A x \text{ }\Box\kern-1.5pt\raise1pt\hbox{$\mathord{\rightarrow}$}\text{ } R x)
$$</p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="bold">4</span>. Exclude all statements that are not compatible with both of <span class="mathinline">\(C, \lnot C\)</span>. But, we get the same problem of nominological incompatibility with <span class="mathinline">\(A\)</span>. And, can't hold fixed the facts that would be the case if <span class="mathinline">\(\lnot A\)</span>. Must pick conditions in <span class="mathinline">\(S\)</span> that are nominological, logically, and counterfactually compatible with <span class="mathinline">\(A\)</span>.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="bold">5</span>. Exclude non-cotenables. But cotenable requires reference to counterfactual conditions, so then we have an infinite regress of evaluation.</span></p><h2 class="h2"><span class="span">Problems with Laws</span></h2><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Goodman thinks that laws can <span class="italic">not</span> be stable under counterfactual conditions. For example if "all coins in my pocket are silver" as a law, <span class="mathinline">\(L\)</span>, doesn't sustain the counterfactual "if I also have a penny, then <span class="mathinline">\(L\)</span>"</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">So the goal of defining laws well is to exclude these sorts of situations. Consider</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Features of laws:</span></p><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">Universal generalizations</span></li><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">Support counterfactuals (can be held in counterfactual conditions)</span></li><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">Confirmed by a limited sample of all-positive instances</span></li><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">Can make predictions with (in the future)</span></li><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Goodman's list of unclear things:</span></p><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">Angle's and Devils</span></li><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">Classes</span></li><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">Dispositions</span></li><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">Counterfactual assertions</span></li><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">Entities/Experiences that are possible but not actual</span></li><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">Nuetrinos</span></li><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">If you find these things clear already, Goodman has nothing more to offer you. He finds these unclear likely because he is sympathetic to empirical positivism</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Leibniz's list of unclear things:</span></p><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">Everything</span></li><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Leibniz wants to use <span class="italic">God</span> as an explanation. And God is bound to reason. So only explanations that are logical derivations from a priori truths are valid.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Hume's list of unclear things:</span></p><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">almost nothing</span></li><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Nothing needs explanation, everything just is. Everything is just a brute fact. A good explanation is just a summary.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Hume and Leibniz (and Spinoza) represent sort of poles to the <span class="italic">explanation</span> question, but people don't really take these extreme opinions anymore.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">What counts as a good explanation of counterfactuals? What counts as a good explanation of anything? Should your sense of a good explanation have a good explanation for your taking it, or should it be axiomatic?</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Does an explanation have to be based upon or conform to the common usage of counterfactuals? Or should the theory be allowed to make certain deviances from the general reasoning, to yield a better theory?</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Well, rather than beating our heads againt the same wall for centuries, lets try something else. How about looking at dispositions? They might be simpler ya know.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Dispositions only talk about a thing, and not any special conditions that must or mustn't be in in order to have the disposition. It just talks about the propensity of a thing to behave a certain way.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Disposiitons are in contrast to manifest properties. So, "strechy" is a disposition wheres "streched" is a manifest property. Or in general, <span class="mathinline">\((\Phi\text{-able})x\)</span> is a disposition of <span class="mathinline">\(x\)</span>, whereas <span class="mathinline">\(\Phi x\)</span> is a manifest property. More specifically, you could think of <span class="mathinline">\(\Phi x\)</span> being the manifestation of the disposition <span class="mathinline">\(x\)</span> to be <span class="mathinline">\(\Phi\)</span>.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">But what if <span class="mathinline">\(\Phi\)</span> is itself a disposition? Then the manifestation of the disposition to <span class="mathinline">\(\Phi\)</span> is having the disposition that <span class="mathinline">\(\Phi\)</span> is.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">But are dispositions just tied directly to counterfactuals?</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Manifest properties are what happens in an event. An event are the things that actually happen.</span></p></div></body>
