Could think of <span class="mathinline">\(\Box\)</span> and <span class="mathinline">\(\Diamond\)</span> as representing different things.

Has that every world is <span class="italic">accessible</span> to every other (accessibility is an equivelance relation).</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">The <span class="mathinline">\(\Box\Diamond\)</span> logic system looks really nice and is easy to use, so people are comitted. But, there are a lot of problematic implications from it.</span></p><h3 class="h3"><span class="span">Types of Necessity/Possibility</span></h3><h4 class="h4"><span class="span">Logical</span></h4><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="mathinline">\(\Box P \iff P\)</span> is True in <span class="italic">all</span> possible worlds.</span></p><h4 class="h4"><span class="span">Metaphyisical</span></h4><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="mathinline">\(\Diamond P \iff P\)</span> is True in at least one possible world.</span></p><h4 class="h4"><span class="span">Nomic</span></h4><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="mathinline">\(P\)</span> is nomically possible relative to world <span class="mathinline">\(W\)</span> iff there is some <span class="mathinline">\(P\)</span>-world whose laws match <span class="mathinline">\(w\)</span>'s laws.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Consider the "twater" situation (Hillary Putnam). <span class="italic">twater</span> is the same as water in every way, expect it is made of XYZ instead of H2O which are very distinct. It is true that water <span class="italic">could</span> be have been twater, in a modal sense? the orthodoxy says no. It says that the meaning of water <span class="italic">is</span> H20, so water could not be twater. But there are other perpectives.</span></p><h4 class="h4"><span class="span">Physical</span></h4><h2 class="h2"><span class="span">Similarity Metric for Possible Worlds</span></h2><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Very controversial. What factors as relevant to similarity? For example,</span></p><div class="quote"><span class="span">"If Cesar fought in Korea, he would have used catapults."</span></div><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">as compared to</span></p><div class="quote"><span class="span">"If Cesar fought in Korea, he would have used tanks."</span></div><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">It really depends on the context to say which is true. Which is the closest world? Hard to say.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Think of how "here" is used. It means different things in different linguistic contexts; it is just a linguistic tool and doesn't have a metaphysical grounding (see <span class="italic">Demonstratives</span> by Kaplan), so can't delve into metaphysical uestions about "here". Do counterfactuals behave like this?</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Quine on coextentionality problem: a property can't be just a set of things with that property, becaues the actuality of those sets doesn't necessarily reflect what we mean by them (two sets are the same if they have the same members, but that doesn't mean the properties are the same). Need to refer to possibilities.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">What is the semantic value to a referring expression? Just the thing being referred to.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Predicates: <span class="italic">intension</span> (set of possible things that satisfy the predicate)</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Names: <span class="italic">extension</span> (thing named), <span class="italic">intension</span> (function from worlds to the extension)</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Sentences: <span class="italic">extension</span> (truth value), <span class="italic">intension</span> (function from worlds to truth values)</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Sentences are decided by the intensions/extensions of their component names and predicates. But this construction doesn't take into account contexts. A context is the tuple <span class="mathinline">\(\langle \text{speaker}, \text{place}, \text{time} \rangle\)</span>.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">So, before we can fully explain how context relates to content, we are just talking philosophy of language and can't really do much in the way of metaphysics.</span></p><h2 class="h2"><span class="span">Modal Analysis</span></h2><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">What is <span class="mathinline">\(P \Box \rightarrow Q\)</span>? Read this as "if <span class="mathinline">\(P\)</span> is true, then <span class="mathinline">\(Q\)</span> would be true" (counterfactual dependence). Its weaker than <span class="mathinline">\(\Box(P \rightarrow Q)\)</span> (every world <span class="mathinline">\(P\)</span> is true, <span class="mathinline">\(Q\)</span> is true) and stronger than <span class="mathinline">\(\Diamond(P \land Q)\)</span> (are copossible). It seems like <span class="mathinline">\(P \Box \rightarrow Q\)</span> is talking about close possible worlds.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="mathinline">\(P \Box \rightarrow Q\)</span> is true at a world <span class="mathinline">\(W\)</span> if <span class="mathinline">\(P \rightarrow Q\)</span> is true in all the <span class="italic">nearest</span> <span class="mathinline">\(P\)</span>-worlds to <span class="mathinline">\(W\)</span> (includes ties).</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Is really hard to come up with an analysis of measuring similarity between world. Lewis thinks that we won't be able to come up with a standard, constant analysis, but as long as our analysis changes all together with our similarity judgements, then we are ok (swinging rope bridge over gorge analogy).</span></p><h2 class="h2"><span class="span">Analysis of Dispositions</span></h2><h4 class="h4"><span class="span">Conditional dispositional predicates</span></h4><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">fragile, inflammible, etc.</span></li><h4 class="h4"><span class="span">Canonical dispositional predicates</span></h4><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">is disposed to <span class="mathinline">\(\phi\)</span> (manifestation conditions) when <span class="mathinline">\(\psi\)</span> (stimulus conditions)</span></li><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">is disposed to <span class="mathinline">\(\phi\)</span></span></li><h4 class="h4"><span class="span">Subjunctive conditional</span></h4><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">if it would <span class="mathinline">\(A\)</span> then it would <span class="mathinline">\(B\)</span></span></li><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">is constructed from the conditional dispositional predicates to the cononical dispositional predicates to these</span></li><h2 class="h2"><span class="span">Solutions to Dispositions with Conditionals</span></h2><h3 class="h3"><span class="span">Counterexample to final solution presented</span></h3><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">So, poison is disposed to kill if ingested because in most of close enough possible worlds, for some context of "enough"</span></li><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">Need some measurement of change that compares different units, like a world that is different in some temperature to a world that is different in the location of an object (a difference that is non-negligable)</span></li><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">But then, moving the location of the poison, say, as far as away as you need to make it not poisonous, is possible.
