If you have <span class="mathinline">\(a,b,c\)</span> that all are <span class="italic">red</span>, then they all share <span class="italic">REDNESS</span>. According to Armstrong, the special feature of a universal is that it can be instanciated multiply, whereas particulars are singular.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="bold">Trope</span>. For example, red <span class="italic">tropes</span> redden the things that they are a part of.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="bold">Platonic Forms</span>. There is the realm of the forms in platonic <span class="italic">heaven</span>. Things only get to be red by participating in the <span class="italic">form of red</span>, and this relationship is not one of the form being in any particular.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="bold">Lewis</span>. You can't analyze away predication in general in terms of universals. This is because in order to analyze predication, you need predication. So, there is an infinite regress if you are trying to get rid of the predication or simplify it. THe new theory is to pick out the natural properties.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="bold">Definition</span>. A <span class="bold">property</span> is a set of things. But does equivelance of members mean equivelance of properties? Lewis doesn't have this problem because he takes his sets over all the possible worlds. But there's a problem with this, because there is no set of everything.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="italic">Note</span>. Sums don't run into the same problem as sets, because you can have, for example <span class="mathinline">\(a,b\)</span> and then make <span class="mathinline">\(a+b\)</span>. But <span class="mathinline">\((a+b)+b\)</span>, which you would create next to generate the heirarchy because it is just equal to <span class="mathinline">\(a+b\)</span> alone. Adding <span class="mathinline">\(b\)</span> didn't actually make anything new.</span></p></div></body>
