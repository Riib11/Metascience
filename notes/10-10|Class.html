$$</p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">So in this case <span class="mathinline">\(E\)</span>, a person's existence, does counterfactually depend on <span class="mathinline">\(C\)</span>, the big bang.</span></p><h2 class="h2"><span class="span">Preemption</span></h2><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Suppose we have the assasin situation. Assassin 1 is aiming to shoot the target. Behind them is Assassin 2, whom's job is to shoot the target if A1 fails to. So, the target getting shot is not counterfactually dependent upon A1 shooting.</span></p><h3 class="h3"><span class="span">Early Preemption</span></h3><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">But if A2 decides to walk away, then the target getting shot does now in fact counterfactually depend on A1 shooting. You don't get to <span class="bold">backtrack</span> and make A2 not walk away. This is early preemption</span></p><h3 class="h3"><span class="span">Late Preemption</span></h3><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">A man eats a large dinner, and then later eats poison. The poison takes longer to take effect because of the dinner. So does the kind of their death cause them to have the dinner? But not eating the dinner would not prevent their death, but <span class="italic">change</span> their death.</span></p><h2 class="h2"><span class="span">New Lewis on Causation</span></h2><h3 class="h3"><span class="span">Trumping Preemption</span></h3><h4 class="h4"><span class="span">Example</span></h4><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Morgana and Merlin both cast a spell on a frog. The laws are that the first person to cast a spell at midnight at time <span class="mathinline">\(x\)</span> will have their spell carried out at time <span class="mathinline">\(x+24\text{hr}\)</span>. If Morgana casts the spell <span class="mathinline">\(S\)</span> and then Merlin casts the spell <span class="mathinline">\(S\p\)</span> 1hr afterwards. Then Morgana's spell will trump Merlins. But if <span class="mathinline">\(S = S\p\)</span>, then it would look the same even if Morgana did not cast her spell.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">This is a problem for Lewis's original theory, because there are no intermediary events or other tricks that Lewis appeals to.</span></p><h4 class="h4"><span class="span">Example</span></h4><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">A major and a sargent both yell command <span class="mathinline">\(C\)</span> and <span class="mathinline">\(C\p\)</span> to their troops. The rule for the troops is that they listen to the highest-ranking officer. But if <span class="mathinline">\(C = C\p\)</span>, then there's the same problem as the previous example. There's no counterfactual dependence on the major's command, and no chain of events to appeal to.</span></p><h3 class="h3"><span class="span">Lewis's Response</span></h3><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">What really makes the higher-ranking cause the actual cause is that <span class="bold">alterations</span> in the higher-ranking cause would change the effect. These alterations yield a range of possibilities, rather than just <span class="mathinline">\(C, \lnot C\)</span>. So, there are a lot of counterfactual conditionals to evaluate. This total is a relation of <span class="bold">influence</span>.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">This idea of <span class="italic">influence</span> gets even fuzzier than counterfactuals, so this new theory is degree-theoretic.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="italic">Note</span>. The point of a firing squad is to make it so each participant can say "well, if i hadn't shot, he still would have died, so i didnt kill him". This is <span class="bold">Torte's Law</span>.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="bold">Definition</span>. If the firefighters influence the fire by lessening it, then they <span class="italic">caused</span> the fire. But <span class="bold">Fragility</span> is how strictly you define the fire. In this example, fragility would appeal to saying the the lessened fire is a different fire, so the firefighters didn't cause the <span class="italic">original</span> fire, because that's a different fire.</span></p><h2 class="h2"><span class="span">Past Counterfactuals</span></h2><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">There's a button that, if pressed, would cause a nuclear holocaust. Assume that there is never a nuclear holocaust. Then the button counterfactual is most likely true, because for any world where the button is pressed, there's a closer world where the button fails than there is a nuclear holocaust (everything in the present would have to be different).</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">This is a problem for Lewis's theory. Do we have to ignore the time since the time of the counterfactual? But Lewis wants to allow backwards causation because we wants to allow time travel.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">If we have determinism, then there's a problem as well. Because then the counterfactual assumes a small miracle. And then afterward no more miracles are allowed.</span></p><h3 class="h3"><span class="span">Lewis's analysis:</span></h3><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">First importance is to not to break lots of laws (large miracles).</span></li><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">Second importance is to avoid large local violations (medium miracles)</span></li><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">Third importance is to avoid small local violations (small miracles)</span></li><li class="unorderedlistitem"><span class="span">Fourth importance is to void changes that are in accordance with the law (changes in matter of fact)</span></li><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="italic">Reference</span>.
