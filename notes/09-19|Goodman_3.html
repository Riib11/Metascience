He thinks that this is not helpful - we cannot know what is not yet known. Basically, you <span class="italic">dont have inductive knowledge</span>. There is no non-circular</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">As for trying to fit in probability, it isn't really knowledge. The old problem is about getting unattainable knowledge. This cannot really be what the problem of induction should be</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="bold">Conclusion</span>. You <span class="italic">can't</span> justify induction in any terms other than itself.</span></p><h2 class="h2"><span class="span">The New Riddle of Induction</span></h2><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Have rules for drawing inferences, and change those over time.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">The new riddle is to explain how we actually use induction. <span class="italic">In which ways will the future resember the past</span>?</span></p><h3 class="h3"><span class="span">The Grue Paradox</span></h3><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="bold">Definition</span>. A thing is <span class="bold">grue</span> if and only if it is first observed before time <span class="mathinline">\(t\)</span> to be green or after time <span class="mathinline">\(t\)</span> as blue.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="bold">Definition</span>. A thing is <span class="bold">bleen</span> if and only if it is first observed before time <span class="mathinline">\(t\)</span> to be blue or after time <span class="mathinline">\(t\)</span> as green.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">These predicates are weird and aren't useful for accurate predictions. But what's so strange about them? Can define "green" and "blue" in terms of them, but "green" and "blue" aren't treated strangely.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="italic">Note</span>. We have to decide what we want to count as a <span class="italic">change</span> and <span class="italic">not a change</span>.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="italic">Looking forward</span>. In looking at the concept of <span class="italic">entrenchment</span>, Goodman  resolves the problem of <span class="italic">grue</span> by declaring is not-enchrenched. This is in fact true, but is not really a satisfying answer to our inquiry into the problem with grue. <span class="italic">Epistemically</span>, what's the problem with grue? He just explains how we do not use grue.</span></p></div></body>
