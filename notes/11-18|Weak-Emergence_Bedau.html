Then things that happen because of emergent properties are <span class="italic">emergent phenomena</span>. Entities that have emergent properties are <span class="italic">emergent entities</span>. You see how this goes.</span></p><h2 class="h2"><span class="span">A New Foundation for Weak Emergence</span></h2><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="italic">Definition</span>. A property <span class="mathinline">\(P\)</span> is <span class="bold">underivable except by simulation</span> if <span class="mathinline">\(P\)</span> can only be derived from a system, even causally closed at the lowest-level, through a complete simulation of the low-level causes (e.g. 'gliders' in GOL). Such a property is argued to be <span class="bold">weakly emergent</span>.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Basically, Bedau's idea is that if a property is interesting and complex, in that it "arises" from the low-level properties of a system in an unpredictable way, then it is indeed weakly emergent.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">It is important to note that Bedau is making a metaphysical point about emergent properties which is independent from epistomological concerns. Just because he haven't yet found a derivation sans simulation for a property doesn't mean that it is emergent - it just looks emergent. Of course, a proof that there is no derivation would work, but that's extremeley hard to come by (especially since the whole <span class="mathinline">\(P = NP\)</span> problem isn't even solved.)</span></p><h2 class="h2"><span class="span">Resultant Properties</span></h2><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Bedua distinguishes truely emergent properties from merely <span class="bold">resultant</span> properties.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span"><span class="italic">Definition</span>. A property <span class="mathinline">\(P\)</span> is a <span class="bold">resultant property</span> if it is predictable from the properties of its parts. Often times, <span class="mathinline">\(P\)</span> is just of a whole in and of itself and not an interesting emergence. <span class="mathinline">\(P\)</span> of the whole that merely holds because of its being a whole as defined. For example, "being a circle" is a property that applies to a collection of points, but no single point in that collection shares the property "being a circle". However, this is uninteresting and is directly predictable from the definition of a circle and the properties of points, without having to do any sort of computation to figure it out.</span></p><h2 class="h2"><span class="span">Game of Life</span></h2><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">In GOL, there are many good examples of properties that are underivable except by simulation. For example, the property "finitely-expanding". A worldstate that, after a finite number of time steps, reaches a maximum <span class="mathinline">\(m \times n\)</span> area in the world such that no matter how many more time steps are run no cell will be born outside the area.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">There are examples of non-finitely-expanding, such as the famous <span class="italic">Gospel Glider Gun</span> that creates gliders in intervals and sends them out into infinity. And there are examples of finitely-expanding, such as any that consists only of non-interacting <span class="italic">still lifes</span>.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">However, to derive if a worldstate is finitely-expanding, one needs to run a simulation. There is not general mathematical theorem that decides this without doing the equivelant of a brute simulation. Even if a mega-computer could do the simulation instantaneously, it would still count as needing a simulation and thus "finitely-expanding" is an emergent property.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">If, however, someone came up with a shortcut, it would prove that "finitely-expanding" is not emergent.</span></p><h2 class="h2"><span class="span">The Problem of Downward Causation</span></h2><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Bedau points out the the main motivation against accepting emergence is, basically, Kim's overdetermination argument. If <span class="mathinline">\(S\)</span> emerges from <span class="mathinline">\(P\)</span> but is syncronically and ontologically dependent on <span class="mathinline">\(P\)</span>, then if <span class="mathinline">\(S\)</span> causes a <span class="mathinline">\(P^*\)</span> then surely we can say that <span class="mathinline">\(P\)</span> causes <span class="mathinline">\(P^*\)</span> as well. But if the low level of the <span class="mathinline">\(P\)</span>s is cuasally closed, then why do we need to talk about <span class="mathinline">\(S\)</span> causing anything at all? It seems irrelevant and problematic in an overdeterminative sense. But if <span class="mathinline">\(S\)</span> was causally inefficacious, then it loses its status of autonomy from <span class="mathinline">\(P\)</span> and is not <span class="italic">really</span> emergent in the first place.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Bedau points out that Kim's concerns are ill-founded. The idea of weak emergence avoids the problems by yielding overdetermination as unproblematic, since it is causally reductionistic and uses ontologically dependence. But such weak emergence is important because it clearly defines autonomous and relevant structures.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Additionally, weak emergence is not synchronic. It introduces a diachronic perspetive on causation, where for example in GOL for a macrostate to have an emergent property, many time steps need to pass. For a microstate to have a property, it must be manifested in one or two time steps. In this cause, emergence properties are causally relevant and distinct from lower-level properties.</span></p><p class="paragraph"><span class="span">Last paragraph of the paper:</span></p><div class="quote"><span class="span">"The advent of modern philosophy is conventionally presented as the Cartesian triumph over Aristotelian scholasticism. An Aristotelian thesis that attributed nature on the basis of a ruch dependence on generating context was supplanted by the Cartesian antithesis that attributed reductionistic essences independent of context. Computer simulations allow weak emergence to extend reductionism into new territory, but they do so by embodying the idea that something's nature can depend on its genesis. Thus, the macro can depend on the context-sensative process from which it arises and by which it is maintained. In this way, weak emergence can be viewed as a new synthesis."</span></div></div></body>
